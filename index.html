        <h2>Our vision statement </h2>
		
        <p>"Creating a New Zealand where every person has the freedom to succeed and the government supports opportunity and personal choice. We aim for a future where liberty and responsibility go hand in hand, and everyone can thrive." - Callum Wood</p>

        <h2>Our Policies</h2>
		
        <ul class="policy-list">
		
		
            <li><strong>Lower the requirements to join the NZ Defence Force. </strong> The current government sets the requirements too high to join the NZ Defence Force, this prevents people with small health issues or disabilities from joining and getting a job. Freedom NZ wants to change that by lowering the requirements. We allow people with minor disabilities; small health issues and we will also allow more entries. If you vote for Freedom NZ, you are making Aotearoa a freer and safer country. </li>

            <li><strong>Decreasing Inflation Prices:</strong> Inflation is making life much worse for many Kiwis. Our plan offers an escape of immediate help and long-term fixes to keep prices under control. By voting for this policy, you’ll help make sure everyone can afford what they need and improve the country’s economy. Vote for us to make things better for everyone in New Zealand. </li>

            <li><strong id=yo>Reduce Transport Prices:</strong> Public transport is way too expensive for many New Zealanders, especially students and low-income families who earn less. Us as Freedom NZ plan to lower the fares that will make travel more affordable and way more accessible for everyone. It will also cut down on traffic and help the economy. By voting for this policy, you’re helping to create a better, cleaner, and more efficient New Zealand for everyone. Vote for Freedom NZ to make a better future. </li>

        <h2>Our possible coalition partner</h2>
		
		<p>Labour wants to make New Zealand a better place to live in by providing opportunities for all, jobs, strong public services, quality education, and affordable healthcare. We believe this can be achieved by keeping assets in Kiwi hands, taking care of our environment, and ensuring we get our economy back in the black without compromising the wellbeing of hardworking Kiwis.</p>
		
		<p> Freedom NZ and Labour both aim to improve life in New Zealand and see public services as important. They differ in their approach: Labour supports more government involvement and fairness, while Freedom NZ favors less government control and more personal freedom. Both are active in politics and run in elections, but they have different ideas on how to achieve their goals. </p>
